Turn a vague prompt like `analyze this stock` into a structured, source-backed, Chinese-first workflow for China stock and A-share research.

This is an open-source agent skills system for China stock research, especially natural for A-share workflows built on public information and Simplified Chinese outputs by default. It is suitable for fundamentals, business analysis, risk monitoring, and valuation framing, but not for real-time market data, automated trading, or proprietary database workflows.

## At A Glance

- `Route first` - identify the research pattern before choosing modules
- `Evidence first` - key facts must carry accessible source links
- `Chinese first` - intermediate and final outputs default to Simplified Chinese

## What You Get

- One parent orchestrator: `china-stock-research-orchestrator`
- Six composable core research modules
- Shared citation standards, pattern overlays, and templates
- A reusable framework built for public-information workflows

## What It Is

- A modular skills pack for China stock research, especially A-share workflows
- A parent orchestrator that identifies analysis patterns and routes the workflow
- Six core modules covering strategy, business quality, financial health, competition, monitoring, and valuation
- Shared standards for sources, citations, output structure, analysis patterns, and overlays

## Who It Is For

- Equity researchers working from public disclosures
- Investors building structured stock research workflows
- Agent users who want reproducible, citation-first company analysis

## Not For

- Real-time quote systems or tick-level trading
- Fully automated investment advice
- Closed-data workflows that depend on paid terminals or private datasets

## Quick Start

Install the skills, then start with the orchestrator. If you only read three lines, this is enough.

Copy-paste remote install command:

```bash
bunx skills add spikeHongg/china-stock-research-skills
```

The placeholder form `bunx skills add <owner>/<repo>` is also correct, but it is less friendly for first-time visitors than a copy-ready example.

Then use this prompt directly:

```text
Use the china-stock-research-orchestrator skill to analyze this China-listed company, identify the main analysis patterns, choose the required modules, and return a source-backed research framework. Default all intermediate and final outputs to Simplified Chinese.
```

For local development:

```bash
bunx skills add . --list
```

See `INSTALL.md` for install details.

## Language Behavior

- `README.md` is the default Simplified Chinese README
- `README.en.md` provides the English version
- All intermediate and final workflow outputs default to Simplified Chinese
- English output should be used only when the user explicitly asks for it
- English technical terms and source titles may be preserved when needed for accuracy and retrieval

See `skills/shared/references/language-output-standard.md`.

## Skill Map

This repository includes 7 skills:

1. `china-stock-research-orchestrator`
2. `strategy-business-transition`
3. `business-decomposition-order-quality`
4. `financial-health`
5. `industry-competition-moat`
6. `risk-warning-catalysts`
7. `valuation-investment-strategy`

See `SKILLS.md` for the full index.

## How It Works

Start with the parent skill:

1. `china-stock-research-orchestrator`

It will:

- identify the company's main analysis patterns
- decide which core modules are required
- load optional overlays only when needed
- merge outputs into one evidence-layered framework

Default full-flow module order:

1. `strategy-business-transition`
2. `business-decomposition-order-quality`
3. `financial-health`
4. `industry-competition-moat`
5. `risk-warning-catalysts`
6. `valuation-investment-strategy`

## Design Principles

- `Evidence first` - every key fact should carry an accessible source link
- `Layered output` - always separate `Facts`, `Interpretation`, and `Open Questions`
- `Official sources first` - disclosures and regulators outrank media summaries
- `Patterns over sectors` - start from reusable analysis patterns, then add sector overlays if needed
- `Composable modules` - the orchestrator routes work but does not replace specialist modules

## Example Prompts

- `Use the china-stock-research-orchestrator skill to decide how this China-listed company should be analyzed and which modules to run.`
- `Use the financial-health skill to diagnose why revenue growth is not converting into profit and cash flow.`
- `Use the industry-competition-moat skill to analyze whether this cyclical materials company is benefiting from a true moat or just a price cycle.`
- `Use the risk-warning-catalysts skill with the healthcare overlay to build a monitoring dashboard for policy, approval, and reimbursement changes.`

## Limitations

- This repository depends on public, accessible information
- It does not guarantee correctness if source documents are incomplete, changed, or unavailable
- It does not replace reading original filings
- It is not investment advice
- Industry overlays are still expanding
